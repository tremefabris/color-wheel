# Color Wheel application

Motivated by an urge to have a colored light in my bedroom (y'know, the ones that allow you to change colors, make them brighter or dimmer, etc) but unwilling to spend money, I'm creating the Color Wheel!

Entirely in Python ('cause I don't need an efficient program), it will use your PC's screen to display basic colors!

## Wanted functionalities

- Open a new tab (maybe a TKinter one?) for the application;
- Display colors;
- Display a color wheel (hence the name) to make changing them intuitive and graphical;
- Brightness slider.

## Requirements

I didn't begin the project yet, so... Python? Let's say: Python 3.8.12.
